    "In this Notebook we will do two exercises. First we will use standard ansi SQL to generate some basic new features. For the second exercise will then use BigQuery ML to train a model and us the build in transformations. BigQuery ML enables users to create and execute machine learning models in BigQuery using SQL queries. The goal is to democratize machine learning by enabling SQL practitioners to build models using their existing tools and to increase development speed by eliminating the need for data movement.\n",
